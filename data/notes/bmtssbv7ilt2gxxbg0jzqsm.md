An array is a collection of items.

    `let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];`

An array can hold any data type (string, number, boolean, etc.)

### Array Declaration

Arrays can be declared as follows:

````
let arr = []

let arr = new Array()```
````

- JavaScript arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different data types. (When those characteristics are undesirable, use typed arrays instead.)
- JavaScript arrays are not associative arrays and so, array elements cannot be accessed using strings as indexes, but must be accessed using integers as indexes.
- JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed: the first element of an array is at index 0, the second is at index 1, and so on â€” and the last element is at the value of the array's length property minus 1.
- JavaScript array-copy operations create shallow copies. (All standard built-in copy operations with any JavaScript objects create shallow copies, rather than deep copies).
