### Stack

- Stack is a data structure that is an array where the first item in is the first item out. Similar to a stack of plates.

  The JavaScript array object `new Array()` already has all the functions to use an Array as a stack.

  - push: Adds an item to the top of the stack.
  - pop: Removes an item from the top of the stack.
  - peek: Returns the item at the top of the stack without removing it.
  - length: Returns the number of items in the stack.
